# Predicting Stroke Risk Based on Demographic and Health-Related Factors

## Project Overview
This project aims to analyze demographic and health-related factors to predict the risk of stroke in patients. We use the "Estimation of Obesity Levels Based on Eating Habits and Physical Condition" dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. Our objective is to explore how lifestyle factors such as diet, physical activity, and BMI contribute to stroke risk.

## Research Question
**What demographic and health-related factors significantly predict the occurrence of a stroke in patients?**

## Dataset
- **Source:** [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/544/estimation+of+obesity+levels+based+on+eating+habits+and+physical+condition)
- **Description:** The dataset contains demographic information, eating habits, and physical condition indicators that help estimate obesity levels.
- **Key Features:**
  - Age, Gender
  - BMI, Physical Activity Level
  - Eating Habits (Frequency of meals, alcohol consumption, etc.)
  - Health Indicators (Family history of obesity, consumption of high-calorie food)

## Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Handle missing values (if any)
   - Convert categorical variables to numerical representations
   - Standardize or normalize numerical features
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Visualize feature distributions
   - Identify correlations between variables
   - Check for class imbalances
3. **Feature Engineering**
   - Create new relevant features based on existing data
   - Perform dimensionality reduction (if needed)
4. **Model Selection & Training**
   - Apply classification models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, Neural Networks)
   - Tune hyperparameters for optimal performance
   - Evaluate using metrics like Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score
5. **Interpretation & Insights**
   - Identify the most significant factors influencing stroke risk
   - Compare model performance
   - Discuss potential real-world applications
