# Estimation of Obesity Levels Based on Eating Habits and Physical Condition

## Project Overview
This project aims to analyze demographic and health-related factors to predict obesity levels in individuals. We use the "Estimation of Obesity Levels Based on Eating Habits and Physical Condition" dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. Our objective is to explore how lifestyle factors such as diet, physical activity, and BMI contribute to obesity.

## Research Question
**What demographic and health-related factors significantly predict obesity levels in individuals?**

## Dataset
- **Source:** [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/544/estimation+of+obesity+levels+based+on+eating+habits+and+physical+condition)
- **Description:** The dataset contains demographic information, eating habits, and physical condition indicators that help estimate obesity levels.
- **Key Features:**
  - Age, Gender
  - BMI, Physical Activity Level
  - Eating Habits (Frequency of meals, alcohol consumption, etc.)
  - Health Indicators (Family history of obesity, consumption of high-calorie food)

## Stakeholders & Their Interest
**Primary Stakeholders:**
1. **Healthcare Professionals & Researchers** – Interested in understanding how lifestyle factors contribute to obesity.
2. **Public Health Organizations** – Can use insights to develop better awareness campaigns and preventive healthcare programs.
3. **Insurance & Policy Makers** – Obesity and its related health risks impact healthcare costs, so insights from this project can guide policy decisions.
4. **Fitness & Nutrition Industries** – Businesses in the health sector can leverage findings to develop personalized diet and exercise programs.
5. **Individuals Concerned About Health** – The general public can benefit from personalized risk assessments based on lifestyle habits.

## Can This Dataset Answer Our Research Question?
- **Yes.** The dataset provides demographic information, physical conditions, and lifestyle habits, which are relevant factors for obesity prediction.

## Value to the Industry
- **Healthcare** – Helps identify key lifestyle-related risk factors for obesity and prevention strategies.
- **Public Health & Policy** – Supports better policy-making for obesity-related health risks.
- **Fitness & Nutrition** – Enables data-driven recommendations for healthier living.

## How Will We Answer Our Business Question?
- We will **analyze the relationships** between lifestyle factors (eating habits, physical activity, BMI) and obesity.
- We will **identify key predictors** that correlate with obesity levels.

## Risks & Uncertainties
1. **Self-Reported Data** – Eating habits and physical activity are self-reported, introducing potential bias.
2. **Generalization Issues** – The dataset's population may not be fully representative of all demographics, limiting external validity.
3. **Feature Limitations** – Critical medical factors (e.g., blood pressure, cholesterol) affecting obesity risk are missing.

## Methods & Technologies
- **Data Analysis & Preprocessing:** Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn)
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** 
- **Feature Engineering:** Encoding categorical variables, handling missing data
- **Machine Learning Models:** Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score
- **Project Management & Collaboration:** GitHub, Jupyter Notebooks

## Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Handle missing values (if any)
   - Convert categorical variables to numerical representations
   - Standardize or normalize numerical features
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Visualize feature distributions
   - Identify correlations between variables
   - Check for class imbalances
3. **Feature Engineering**
   - Create new relevant features based on existing data
   - Perform dimensionality reduction (if needed)
4. **Model Selection & Training**
   - Apply classification models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, Neural Networks)
   - Tune hyperparameters for optimal performance
   - Evaluate using metrics like Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score
5. **Interpretation & Insights**
   - Identify the most significant factors influencing obesity levels
   - Compare model performance
   - Discuss potential real-world applications
